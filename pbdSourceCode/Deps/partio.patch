-/** \page cpptut C++ Tutorial
-
-Here is a simple example of some operations supported by particles. You may want
-to look at the includes demo applications and tools in the source tree to see
-more examples.
-
-<h2>Intro</h2>
-
-The C++ API is easy to use. You just need to include 
-<pre>
-#include <Partio.h>
-</pre>
-Everything Partio related is in the Partio namespace. To read a particle file in
-and print the number of particles you could do:
-<pre>
-Partio::ParticlesDataMutable* data=Partio::read("test.bgeo");
-std::cout&lt;&lt;"Number of particles "&lt;&lt;data-&gt;numParticles()&lt;&lt;std::endl;
-</pre>
-Now we could additionally print out the names of all attributes in the particle
-file as 
-<pre>
-for(int i=0;i&lt;data-&gt;numAttributes();i++){
-    Partio::ParticleAttribute attr;
-    data-&gt;attributeInfo(i,attr);
-    std::cout&lt;&lt;"attribute["&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;"] is "&lt;&lt;attr.name&lt;&lt;std::endl;
-}
-</pre>
-Now we could convert the data into RenderMan ptc format as
-<pre>
-Partio::write("test.ptc",*data);
-</pre>
-Whenever you are done with a particle set you need to release it as
-<pre>
-data-&gt;release();
-</pre>
-
-<h2>Simple processing</h2>
-
-Suppose we wanted to average all the positions in a particle file. We could do
-that by iterating over each particle and getting the position attribute value as
-follows:
-<pre>
-Partio::ParticleAttribute posAttr;
-if(!data-&gt;attributeInfo("position",attr)
-   || (attr.type != Partio::FLOAT && attr.type != Partio::VECTOR)
-   || attr.count != 3){
-   std::cerr&lt;&lt;"Failed to get proper position attribute"&lt;&lt;std::endl;
-}
-
-float avg[3]={0,0,0};
-
-
-for(int i=0;i&lt;data-&gt;numParticles();i++){
-    float *pos=data-&gt;data<float>(posAttr,i);
-    for(int k=0;k<3;k++) avg[k]+=pos[k];
-}
-for(int k=0;k<3;k++) pos[k]/=data-&gt;numParticles();
-std::cerr&lt;&lt;"avg "&lt;&lt;pos[0]&lt;&lt;" "&lt;&lt;pos[1]&lt;&lt;" "&lt;&lt;pos[2]<<std::endl;
-</pre>

-\title{Partio: Tutorial and Documentation}
-\author{Andrew Selle}
-\maketitle
-
-\section{Introduction}
-
-Partio is a library for manipulating and handling particles. It is designed to be as easy to use as possible while still allowing relatively good performance.  The data model is designed to
-accomidate most particle formats in some way.
-
-\section{Data Model}
-
-Partio does not specify how data should be organized in a memory or on the file. It does have a model interface that all particle formats need to implement. This consists of three different
-levels of data access
-
-\begin{enumerate}
-\item ParticlesHeaders - Number of particles, attribute types and names
-\item ParticlesData - Read access to all data
-\item ParticlesDataMutable - Write access to all data
-\end{enumerate}
-
-Fundamentally a particle is an indexable item that has associated attributes. There can be zero or more attributes, and technically, position is not requires. On the other hand, many of the
-file formats (BGEO, GEO, PTC) require position to be present to write a useful file.
-
-\subsection{Attribute Data Types}
-
-There are three data types supported. 
-\begin{enumerate}
-\item FLOAT - Floating point data, 4 bytes per float
-\item VECTOR - Floating point data
-\item INT - Integer data type
-\end{enumerate}
-In addition each attribute is actually an array that can consist of one or more elements. A vector is a special case of a FLOAT and must have a count of 3.  This is to match a common case
-where a position is a 3 float value.  (This is modeled loosely after PDB/PDA formats). 
-
-\subsection{Attributes}
-
-Each particle set has a list of attributes that are available. Each of these attributes has a data type and a string representing the name of the attribute.  Particle attributes are
-represented by the class \verb|ParticleAttribute|.  A particle class can be queried for individual particle attributes which then become handles that allow stringless (efficient) access to
-particle attributes.
-
-\section{Python API}
-
-The python API is designed for ease of use. For speed critical applications, C++ API should be used.  Looping in python is extremely slow.  It is hoped that in the future a mapping to numpy
-might be provided to allow manipulating particles in a SIMD fashion.  Nevertheless, python API remains useful for manipulating particles
-
-To use Partio's python API first import partio as
-\begin{verbatim}
->>> import partio
-\end{verbatim}
-Help on functions that are available are shown in 
-\begin{verbatim}
->>> help(partio)
-\end{verbatim}
-
-\subsection{Creating a Particle Set}
-
-To create a particle set and add a couple of attributes one could write
-\begin{verbatim}
-particleSet=partio.create()
-P=particleSet.addAttribute("position",partio.VECTOR,3)
-V=particleSet.addAttribute("velocity",partio.VECTOR,3)
-id=particleSet.addAttribute("id",partio.INT,1)
-\end{verbatim}
-Once this is done, we could add a series of particles that form a circle
-\begin{verbatim}
-n=30
-radiansPer=2*math.pi/n
-particleSet.addParticles(n)
-for i in range(n):
-    particleSet.set(P,i,(math.cos(i*radiansPer),0,math.sin(i*radiansPer)))
-    particleSet.set(V,i,(0,0,0))
-    particleSet.set(id,i,(i,))
-\end{verbatim}
-Finally, we can write the particle file into a BGEO by writing 
-\begin{verbatim}
-partio.write("circle.bgeo",particleSet) # write uncompressed
-partio.write("circle.bgeo",particleSet,True) # write compressed
-partio.write("circle.bgeo.gz",particleSet) # write compressed
-\end{verbatim}
-We can then visualize the particle set with
-\begin{verbatim}
-partview circle.bgeo
-\end{verbatim}
-giving\\
-\includegraphics{figures/circleFigure.png}
-
-
-\subsection{Loading a particle set}
-
-Loading a particle set is relatively easy.  If you only want to know how many particles are available or what headers are available you can do
-\begin{verbatim}
->>> pHeaders=partio.readHeaders("circle.bgeo")
-\end{verbatim}
-If you want everything associated with the file
-\begin{verbatim}
->>> p=partio.read("circle.bgeo")
-\end{verbatim}
-\end{document}
-
-\subsection{Finding nearest neighbors}
-
-A KD-Tree mode is supported in partio.  To use it, you must first sort the particles into a KD-Tree. This is done with the \verb|sort()| function.  Once that is done a query can be done. The
-basic query requires a maximum distance to look for particles as well as a maximum number of particles to return. For example, we could read our circle back in and look for particles nearby
-(1,0,0) like so:
-\begin{verbatim}
-p=partio.read("circle.bgeo")
-p.sort()
-p.findNPoints((1.,0.,0.),.1,3)
-\end{verbatim}

-<h2>Finding nearest neighbors</h2>
-
-A KD-Tree mode is supported in partio.  To use it, you must first sort the particles into a KD-Tree. This is done with the \verb|sort()| function.  Once that is done a query can be done. The
-basic query requires a maximum distance to look for particles as well as a maximum number of particles to return. For example, we could read our circle back in and look for particles nearby
-(1,0,0) like so:
-<pre>
-p=partio.read("circle.bgeo")
-p.sort()
-p.findNPoints((1.,0.,0.),.1,3)
-</pre>
